Description: Train a masked language model on TPUs using ðŸ¤— Transformers.
Accelerator: TPU
"""

"""
## Introduction

In this example, we cover how to train a masked language model using TensorFlow,
[ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index),
and TPUs.

TPU training is a useful skill to have: TPU pods are high-performance and extremely
scalable, making it easy to train models at any scale from a few tens of millions of
parameters up to truly enormous sizes: Google's PaLM model
(over 500 billion parameters!) was trained entirely on TPU pods.

We've previously written a
[**tutorial**](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/perf_train_tpu_tf)
and a
[**Colab example**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/tpu_training-tf.ipynb)
showing small-scale TPU training with TensorFlow and introducing the core concepts you
need to understand to get your model working on TPU. However, our Colab example doesn't
contain all the steps needed to train a language model from scratch such as
training the tokenizer. So, we wanted to provide a consolidated example of
walking you through every critical step involved there.

As in our Colab example, we're taking advantage of TensorFlow's very clean TPU support
via XLA and `TPUStrategy`. We'll also be benefiting from the fact that the majority of
the TensorFlow models in ðŸ¤— Transformers are fully
[XLA-compatible](https://huggingface.co/blog/tf-xla-generate).
So surprisingly, little work is needed to get them to run on TPU.

This example is designed to be **scalable** and much closer to a realistic training run
-- although we only use a BERT-sized model by default, the code could be expanded to a
much larger model and a much more powerful TPU pod slice by changing a few configuration
options.

The following diagram gives you a pictorial overview of the steps involved in training a
language model with ðŸ¤— Transformers using TensorFlow and TPUs:

"""

"""
## Data

We use the
[WikiText dataset (v1)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikitext).
You can head over to the
[dataset page on the Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikitext)
to explore the dataset.

![data_preview_wikitext](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sayakpaul/sample-datasets/resolve/main/data_preview_wikitext.png)

Since the dataset is already available on the Hub in a compatible format, we can easily
load and interact with it using
[ðŸ¤— datasets](https://hf.co/docs/datasets).
However, training a language model from scratch also requires a separate
tokenizer training step. We skip that part in this example for brevity, but,
here's a gist of what we can do to train a tokenizer from scratch:

- Load the `train` split of the WikiText using ðŸ¤— datasets.
- Leverage
[ðŸ¤— tokenizers](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/index)
to train a
[**Unigram model**](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter6/7?fw=pt).
- Upload the trained tokenizer on the Hub.

You can find the tokenizer training
code
[**here**](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/tensorflow/language-modeling-tpu#training-a-tokenizer)
and the tokenizer
[**here**](https://huggingface.co/tf-tpu/unigram-tokenizer-wikitext).
This script also allows you to run it with
[**any compatible dataset**](https://huggingface.co/datasets?task_ids=task_ids:language-modeling)
from the Hub.
"""

"""
## Tokenizing the data and creating TFRecords

Once the tokenizer is trained, we can use it on all the dataset splits
(`train`, `validation`, and `test` in this case) and create TFRecord shards out of them.
Having the data splits spread across multiple TFRecord shards helps with massively
parallel processing as opposed to having each split in single TFRecord files.

We tokenize the samples individually. We then take a batch of samples, concatenate them
together, and split them into several chunks of a fixed size (128 in our case). We follow
this strategy rather than tokenizing a batch of samples with a fixed length to avoid
aggressively discarding text content (because of truncation).

We then take these tokenized samples in batches and serialize those batches as multiple
TFRecord shards, where the total dataset length and individual shard size determine the
number of shards. Finally, these shards are pushed to a
[Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/buckets).

If you're using a TPU node for training, then the data needs to be streamed from a GCS
bucket since the node host memory is very small. But for TPU VMs, we can use datasets
locally or even attach persistent storage to those VMs. Since TPU nodes (which is what we
have in a Colab) are still quite heavily used, we based our example on using a GCS bucket
for data storage.

You can see all of this in code in
[this script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/tensorflow/language-modeling-tpu/prepare_tfrecord_shards.py).
For convenience, we have also hosted the resultant TFRecord shards in
[this repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tf-tpu/wikitext-v1-tfrecords)
on the Hub.

Once the data is tokenized and serialized into TFRecord shards, we can proceed toward
training.
"""

"""
## Training

### Setup and imports

Let's start by installing ðŸ¤— Transformers.
"""

"""shell
pip install transformers -q
"""

"""
Then, let's import the modules we need.
"""

import os
import re

import tensorflow as tf

import transformers

"""
### Initialize TPUs
"""

"""
Then let's connect to our TPU and determine the distribution strategy:
"""

tpu = tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver()

tf.config.experimental_connect_to_cluster(tpu)
tf.tpu.experimental.initialize_tpu_system(tpu)

strategy = tf.distribute.TPUStrategy(tpu)

print(f"Available number of replicas: {strategy.num_replicas_in_sync}")

"""
We then load the tokenizer. For more details on the tokenizer, check out
[its repository](https://huggingface.co/tf-tpu/unigram-tokenizer-wikitext).
For the model, we use RoBERTa (the base variant), introduced in
[this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692).
"""

"""
### Initialize the tokenizer
"""

tokenizer = "tf-tpu/unigram-tokenizer-wikitext"
pretrained_model_config = "roberta-base"

tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(tokenizer)
config = transformers.AutoConfig.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_config)
config.vocab_size = tokenizer.vocab_size

"""
### Prepare the datasets
"""

"""
We now load the TFRecord shards of the WikiText dataset (which the Hugging Face team
prepared beforehand for this example):
"""

train_dataset_path = "gs://tf-tpu-training-resources/train"
eval_dataset_path = "gs://tf-tpu-training-resources/validation"

training_records = tf.io.gfile.glob(os.path.join(train_dataset_path, "*.tfrecord"))
eval_records = tf.io.gfile.glob(os.path.join(eval_dataset_path, "*.tfrecord"))

"""
Now, we will write a utility to count the number of training samples we have. We need to
know this value in order properly initialize our optimizer later:
"""


def count_samples(file_list):
    num_samples = 0
    for file in file_list:
        filename = file.split("/")[-1]
        sample_count = re.search(r"-\d+-(\d+)\.tfrecord", filename).group(1)
        sample_count = int(sample_count)
        num_samples += sample_count

    return num_samples


num_train_samples = count_samples(training_records)
print(f"Number of total training samples: {num_train_samples}")

"""
Let's now prepare our datasets for training and evaluation. We start by writing our
utilities. First, we need to be able to decode the TFRecords:
"""

max_sequence_length = 512


def decode_fn(example):
    features = {
        "input_ids": tf.io.FixedLenFeature(
            dtype=tf.int64, shape=(max_sequence_length,)
        ),
        "attention_mask": tf.io.FixedLenFeature(
            dtype=tf.int64, shape=(max_sequence_length,)
        ),
    }
    return tf.io.parse_single_example(example, features)


"""
Here, `max_sequence_length` needs to be the same as the one used during preparing the
TFRecord shards.Refer to
[this script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/tensorflow/language-modeling-tpu/prepare_tfrecord_shards.py)
for more details.

Next up, we have our masking utility that is responsible for masking parts of the inputs
and preparing labels for the masked language model to learn from. We leverage the
[`DataCollatorForLanguageModeling`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.29.1/en/main_classes/data_collator#transformers.DataCollatorForLanguageModeling)
for this purpose.
"""

# We use a standard masking probability of 0.15. `mlm_probability` denotes
# probability with which we mask the input tokens in a sequence.
mlm_probability = 0.15
data_collator = transformers.DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(
    tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm_probability=mlm_probability, mlm=True, return_tensors="tf"
)


def mask_with_collator(batch):
    special_tokens_mask = (
        ~tf.cast(batch["attention_mask"], tf.bool)
        | (batch["input_ids"] == tokenizer.cls_token_id)
        | (batch["input_ids"] == tokenizer.sep_token_id)

    batch["input_ids"], batch["labels"] = data_collator.tf_mask_tokens(
        batch["input_ids"],
        vocab_size=len(tokenizer),
        mask_token_id=tokenizer.mask_token_id,
        special_tokens_mask=special_tokens_mask,
    )
    return batch


"""
And now is the time to write the final data preparation utility to put it all together in
a `tf.data.Dataset` object:
"""

auto = tf.data.AUTOTUNE
shuffle_buffer_size = 2**18


def prepare_dataset(
    records, decode_fn, mask_fn, batch_size, shuffle, shuffle_buffer_size=None

    #  all the records yet, so we assert it here.

    return dataset


"""
Let's prepare our datasets with these utilities:
"""

per_replica_batch_size = 16  # Change as needed.
batch_size = per_replica_batch_size * strategy.num_replicas_in_sync
shuffle_buffer_size = 2**18  # Default corresponds to a 1GB buffer for seq_len 512

Let's now investigate how a single batch of dataset looks like.
"""

single_batch = next(iter(train_dataset))
print(single_batch.keys())

"""
* `input_ids` denotes the tokenized versions of the input samples containing the mask

Now, we can leverage our `tokenizer` to investigate the values of the tokens. Let's start
with `input_ids`:
"""

idx = 0
print("Taking the first sample:\n")
print(tokenizer.decode(input_ids[idx].numpy()))

"""
As expected, the decoded tokens contain the special tokens including the mask tokens as
well. Let's now investigate the mask tokens:
"""

# Taking the first 30 tokens of the first sequence.
print(labels[0].numpy()[:30])

"""
Here, `-100` means that the corresponding tokens in the `input_ids` are NOT masked and
non `-100` values denote the actual values of the masked tokens.
"""

"""
## Initialize the mode and and the optimizer
"""

"""
With the datasets prepared, we now initialize and compile our model and optimizer within
the `strategy.scope()`:
"""

# For this example, we keep this value to 10. But for a realistic run, start with 500.

steps_per_epoch = num_train_samples // (
    per_replica_batch_size * strategy.num_replicas_in_sync

"""
A couple of things to note here:
* The
[`create_optimizer()`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/optimizer_schedules#transformers.create_optimizer)
function creates an Adam optimizer with a learning rate schedule using a warmup phase
followed by a linear decay. Since we're using weight decay here, under the hood,
`create_optimizer()` instantiates
[the right variant of Adam](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/118e9810687dd713b6be07af79e80eeb1d916908/src/transformers/optimization_tf.py#L172)
to enable weight decay.
* While compiling the model, we're NOT using any `loss` argument. This is because
the TensorFlow models internally compute the loss when expected labels are provided.
Based on the model type and the labels being used, `transformers` will automatically
infer the loss to use.

"""
### Start training!
"""

"""
Next, we set up a handy callback to push the intermediate training checkpoints to the
Hugging Face Hub. To be able to operationalize this callback, we need to log in to our
Hugging Face account (if you don't have one, you create one
[here](https://huggingface.co/join) for free). Execute the code below for logging in:

```python

Let's now define the
[`PushToHubCallback`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/keras_callbacks#transformers.PushToHubCallback):

And now, we're ready to chug the TPUs:
"""

# In the interest of the runtime of this example,
# we limit the number of batches to just 2.

    train_dataset.take(2),
    validation_data=eval_dataset.take(2),
    epochs=num_epochs,
    callbacks=callbacks,

# After training we also serialize the final model.
model.save_pretrained(output_dir)

"""
Once your training is complete, you can easily perform inference like so:
"""

from transformers import pipeline

# Replace your `model_id` here.
# Here, we're using a model that the Hugging Face team trained for longer.
model_id = "tf-tpu/roberta-base-epochs-500-no-wd"
